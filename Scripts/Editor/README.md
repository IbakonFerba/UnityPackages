## NodeEditor
- A Base for a node based Editor with multiple types of nodes and variable numbers of connections per node. To create your own Node Based Editor, create an Editor class that inherits from this one. Make sure to call OnEnable and OnGui of this script if you overwrite them. This was created using this Tutorial as a base: http://gram.gs/gramlog/creating-node-based-editor-unity/
To use this, import the namespace `FK.Editor.NodeEditor`
