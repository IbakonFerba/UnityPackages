# Particle Attractor
This Package contains a Component that makes a GameObject attract particles from registered Particle Systems. You can create an Attractor by attaching the `ParticleAttractor` Component to any GameObject or by going to `GameObject/Effects/Particle Attractor`.
If you enable the custom data module in an affected Particle System and Set Custom1 to a Vector with one Component, that will be used as the terminal velocity for the particles
