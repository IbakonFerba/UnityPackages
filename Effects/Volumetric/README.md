# Volumetric
Everything Volumetric

## Volumetric Objects
- With this package, you can render proper volumetric Objects! Shapes currently supported are:
  - Box
  - Sphere
  - Capsule
- You can create Volumetric Objects via the GameObject Creation Menu under `Volumetric`
- When you create a Volumetric Object, it will automatically add the `VolumetricObjectRenderer` to the Main camera of the Scene. You can change some quality Options there.
- Every Volumetric Objects requires an Image Effect pass, so be careful with how many you draw!
